read me: hello!
my name is himi and this is ClickME! software, not actually but it's exe file from powershell script "ps1"
but hey this is just from ChatGPT
IMPORTANT: if you wanna run the game just click on "start1.exe" file and done
but it will show up powershell with nothing on it but if you close the powershell window,
the clickme.exe will also close.

So in the future, maybe I will update this.

note: 9 billion is "congrate"
and if you cheat or use an autoclicker, it's fine
'cause this script is too powerful.
Every click will save the file "0" every time you click the button.
Good luck with your PC and laptop to get 9 billion points :D
